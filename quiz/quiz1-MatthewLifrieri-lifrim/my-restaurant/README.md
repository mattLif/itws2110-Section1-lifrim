For parts 1-3 of quiz 1, I designed a 4-item menu for a fictional restaurant. I first had to design the JSON file that would include that data for my menu items. I went with my go-to orders from my local Chinese and Japanese restaurants back home. Figuring out generic recipes and finding images after that was pretty simple, and I included my sources up above. My restaurant was following a trend of southeast/eastern Asian cuisine, so I came up with the name East Feast. I then created my HTML document, defining the elements my 4 menu items would be generated into by AJAX, as well as a header and footer for my menu. I then designed my CSS, taking inspiration from my previous labs, such as including animated movement when an item is hovered and sticky header and footer. Lastly, I designed the AJAX within my JavaScript file. This was really simple, only including the fetch request, a loop to display all my data, and error catching messages.

Hello! Lab 2 went pretty smoothly for me with minimal difficulty. One "problem" I had at first was deciding on what the overall layout of the site would be. I didn't want a giant text dump on one page, so I took some inspiration from the given source: https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/. I decided a main page with the constitution's contents would be best, and links to each analysis page would be tied to their respective text. My groupmates and I then expanded on that original idea to reach the final format we have now. The only other issue I (and the rest of my group faced) was version control. We at first thought working on one branch together would be simpler, but when merge conflicts and overwriting of info occured, we used seperate branches instead. This solved our issue and development went smoothly there after.

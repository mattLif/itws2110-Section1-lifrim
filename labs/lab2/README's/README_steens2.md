Lab 2: The purpose of this lab was to design and build an interactive website for the United States Constitution in honor of Constitution Week. The project focused on presenting the Constitutionâ€™s text, history, and principles in a way that is both educational and accessible to a wide audience. Our goal was to display the content in an interactive way and encourage exploration and understanding of the Constitution through a clear structure, intuitive navigation, and engaging visual design. By creating this site, we sought to demonstrate the importance of constitutional principles in American history and civic life while also practicing collaborative web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and project management in a team setting. The team collaborated on research, styling, and design decisions to complete this lab.

Contributions: For this lab, we all contributed for researching each section. Additionally, I was responsible for doing the write up for the history and preamble. My primary contribution, however, was creating the CSS styling for the home page, and a consistent styling for the amendments, preamble page, and articles page. Based on the others quotes and analyses, I went in and adjusted their code to add the styling sheet I created. Additionally, I was responsible for fixing the links and ensuring everything functioned as intended. 

Temporary Blockers: The biggest blocker I faced for this lab was converting each of our individual research into a common webpage styling theme. Given that we all worked on this indiviudally and on our own time, we did not name our categories the same thing, nor did we establish coding conventions across how we would design the pages and name them. As a result, when I was adding styling to each of the pages, I had to change the way each variable/attribute was named so that it would apply to the styling sheet without needing to create fix copies of the same css to apply to the attributes each individual used. As a result, there was a lot of busy work that happened to fix each page and get it to work for the CSS sheet. Going forward, we will try to establish coding conventions ahead of time, and if possible create the mockup UI so that we can design in more of a "fill in the blanks" method, rather than copy pasting stuff around to fix everything.

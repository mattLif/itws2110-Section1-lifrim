Problems
- We had problems with collaborating with each other and overriding each other's code. We initially thought it would be easier if we all worked in the same branch so as to not overcomplicate things, however, when my analysises were overwritten I then made a habit of creating a seperate branch to ensure no merge conflicts would occur and to not write over any one's code.

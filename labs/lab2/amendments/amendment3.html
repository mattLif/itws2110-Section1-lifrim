                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>The Third Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says that soldiers cannot be housed in private homes without the owner's consent. This amendment was originally written as a result of when British soldiers would forcibly quarter themselves within colonists' homes. While the literal contents of this amendment are not very relevant today, the idea that it reinforces is. A person's home and personal privacy shall not be breached by the government, unless there is lawful reason to do so.</p>

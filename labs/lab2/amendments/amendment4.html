                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government, balancing public safety with an individual's right to private propery. It requires that law enforcement obtain a warrant, supported by probable cause, before searching someone's home, property, or personal belongings. Similar to the Third Amendment, this reinforces the idea that an individual reserves the right to privacy unless a lawful reason is given. While the amendment itself refers to physical property ("houses, papers, and effects"), today it also includes digital data, such as phones and computers.</p>

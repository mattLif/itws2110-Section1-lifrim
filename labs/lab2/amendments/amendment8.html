                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>This amendment was created to prevent any punishments for crimes to not be excessive or cruel or for any barbaric penalities to be instilled. For example, setting a unusally large bail amount for a minor crime would be illegal under this amendment. This was to give citizens a proportionate discplining based on their crime and their ability to pay for them.</p>

                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>This amendment’s purpose is to grant citizens the right to a trial by a jury of one’s peers in federal civil cases involving disputes with money or property worth more than 20$. This amendment also prohibits federal courts from reexamining facts that have already been decided by a jury, ensuring the finality of a jury’s judgement. It also says that issues of law are determined by a judge and issues of fact are decided by a jury.</p>

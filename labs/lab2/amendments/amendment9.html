                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>This means that while some rights are not stated in the constitution, that does not mean they are not protected or given. The rights or fundamental liberties that are not stated specifically in the Constitution are known as the unenumerated rights. This amendment was added to address concerns that because of the Bill of Rights exhaustive nature it does not encompass all protected rights.</p>

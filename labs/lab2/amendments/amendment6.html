                <p class="quoted">"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed; which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor; and to have the assistance of counsel for his defence."</p>

                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>These statements explain that all U.S. citizens are given the right to a fair trial that does not involve unnecessary delay. The trial must be held at the same district and state that the suspected crime was committed and the suspect has the right to be informed of the cause of accusation for said crime. Defendants are given the right to cross-examine witnesses and to bring forth their own witnesses to testify in their defense. It is also said that defendents have the right to have a lawyer assist them in their counsel, and if they cannot afford a lawyer, the government must provide one.</p>

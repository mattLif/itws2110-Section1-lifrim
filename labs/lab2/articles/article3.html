                <h2>Section 1: Establishment of the Judicial Office</h2>
                <p class="quoted">"The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish."</p>

                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>This section established a Judicial Branch, composed of a superior Supreme court, and several lower inferior courts. Each judge is given a compensation and shall hold their office as long as they act in accordance of 'Good Behavior'.</p>

                <h2>Section 2: Judicial Reach</h2>
                <p class="quoted">"The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish."</p>

                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>The Judicial Branch's power extends to many matters. All trials besides Impeachment must be held with both a Judge and a jury. A judicial decision will extend to all laws, and act as if it is a new amendment. This strong power shows how impactful the judicial branch can be.</p>

                <h2>Section 3: Treason</h2>
                <p class="quoted">"The Congress shall have Power to declare the Punishment of Treason, but no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted."</p>

            <div class="analysis">
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>The act of Treason can only be committed in the context of aiding an enemy or through declaring war against the United States. A person may only be convicted of treason with multiple witnesses or through an open confession, and only Congress has the power to administer the 'Punishment of Treason'.</p>

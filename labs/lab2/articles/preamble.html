                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>The Preamble serves as the introduction to the United States Constitution, establishing that government authority comes from the people rather than a monarch or ruling class. It sets out six key goals for the new government: to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for future generations. Although it does not grant specific powers, the Preamble provides the philosophical foundation for the Constitution, reflecting Enlightenment ideals of government by consent of the governed and continuing to guide constitutional interpretation today.</p>

                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>Article VI covers three major points: (1) it confirms that debts and obligations from before the Constitution remain valid, ensuring continuity; (2) it establishes the “Supremacy Clause,” making the Constitution, federal laws, and treaties the highest law of the land, taking precedence over conflicting state laws; and (3) it requires all government officials: federal and state to swear an oath to support the Constitution, while prohibiting religious tests for public office, ensuring religious freedom in governance.</p>

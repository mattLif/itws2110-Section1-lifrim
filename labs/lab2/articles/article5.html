                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>Article V establishes the process for amending the Constitution. Amendments can be proposed either by a two-thirds majority in both Houses of Congress or by a convention called by two-thirds of state legislatures. Ratification requires approval by three-fourths of the states, either through legislatures or state conventions. It protects equal representation in the Senate by prohibiting amendments that would take away a state’s equal suffrage without consent.</p>

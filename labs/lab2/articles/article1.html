                <p>The House of Representatives is formally introduced. It declares a state's population is tied to its number of representatives, how a state's population will be counted, and how this population will be evaluated every 10 years. Concepts of term limits and the power of Impeachment are also introduced, which will set the House apart from the Senate. It alone has the unique power of Impeachment.</p>

                <h2>Section 3: Composition of the Senate</h2>

If selected, they are 1 of 2 senators for their state, and will preside for a 6 year term. Their specific given power is to ratify an Impeachment vote from the House of Representatives.

                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>Each House follows similar rules and is afforded similar freedoms in attending Congress and running their elections. A majority is required to be in attendance for Congress to be in session. Each is responsible for writing and following their own procedure for meetings, and are required to publish notes on their meetings in the Journal of Procedings. Neither House may adjorn for more than 3 days when Congress is in session.</p>

            <div class="analysis">
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>This legislative body can write laws through Bills. After a bill is approved by both the House of Representatives and the Senate, it is delivered to the President for consideration. Upon the President's approval the Bill becomes law. If the Bill is rejected, or is left unaddressed for 10 days, the Congress may still sign the Bill into law through a 2/3rds majority in each House.</p>

                <h2>Section 8: Other Powers of Congress</h2>

            <div class="analysis">
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>This Section outlines many different powers of Congress. These include but are not limited to: production of currencies, securing financial institutions, establishing the Post Office, raise armies, and declare war.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-card">
                <h2>Section 9: Limitations of Congress</h2>
                <p class="quoted">"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="analysis">
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>In this section, various rules are outlined that limit the powers of Congress. An example of this is in the first paragraph, which prevents Congress from stopping the Slave Trade. This shows how the Founding Fathers considered both powers and limitations as constructs for building a benevolent government.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-card">
                <h2>Section 10: Limitations of State Rights</h2>
                <p class="quoted">"No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="analysis">
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>State rights are limited similarly to how the Congress limits itself in Section 9. These limitations extend the Congressional limitations to the state level, but also introduce some ability for States to self-govern. </p>

Lab 2: The purpose of this lab was to design and build an interactive website for the United States Constitution in honor of Constitution Week. The project focused on presenting the Constitutionâ€™s text, history, and principles in a way that is both educational and accessible to a wide audience. Our goal was to display the content in an interactive way and encourage exploration and understanding of the Constitution through a clear structure, intuitive navigation, and engaging visual design. By creating this site, we sought to demonstrate the importance of constitutional principles in American history and civic life while also practicing collaborative web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and project management in a team setting. The team collaborated on research, styling, and design decisions to complete this lab.

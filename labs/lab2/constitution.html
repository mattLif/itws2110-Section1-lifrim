            <div class="section-content">
                 <p>The United States Constitution was drafted in 1787 at the Philadelphia Convention, later known as the Constitutional Convention. Following the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation, which left the national government too weak to manage finances, regulate trade, or enforce laws, delegates from twelve states (all but Rhode Island) met to design a more effective system. Key figures such as George Washington, who presided over the convention, and James Madison, often called the “Father of the Constitution,” played leading roles in shaping the document. The delegates debated fiercely over issues like the balance of power between large and small states, the role of the executive, and the protection of individual liberties, eventually reaching compromises such as the Great Compromise and the Three-Fifths Compromise. After months of deliberation, the Constitution was signed on September 17, 1787, and later ratified by the states, establishing a stronger federal government while still preserving the principle of state sovereignty.</p>

Prompts (ChatGPT):
1. Give me an HTML document that utilizes the given OpenWeatherMap API to display the current weather in Troy, NY. This HTML document should include valid CSS, AJAX, and JSON. You may also utilize another free API to compliment the site. https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key} API KEY: 4bb9ed31d2c2545dcc76ccb949d0ec42
2. Don't use the API's icons, don't leave src blank when declaring an img element as that is invalid html, and utilize another free api, such as displaying the holidays of the day or a random quote
3. your quote box is returning "Could not load quote."
4. your zenquotes API failed to fetch with this error: ﻿ weather.html:1 Access to fetch at 'https://zenquotes.io/api/random' from origin 'http://127.0.0.1:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
5. your new API fails to fetch as well
6. fails with a 400 error
7. your quotes still fail with "Quote proxy 400"
8. Just scrap the quote idea all together and just include the holidays. Also try to add another free api idea to the web app
9. try to use an API that does not include images (everything on this web app should be AI generated).
10. I liked the css format we had before, can we go back?
11. you didn't change it back.
12. Can you add a header to the site, as well as fixing the background so it doesn't look cut up. Also, the refresh buttons are a good idea.
13. can you make it so that when you hover a section on the site, it is emphasized by an animation such as growing or brightening?
14. add headers so that the HTML is valid without warnings


Hello!
For lab 4, I had to use ChatGPT to repeat lab 3. This was a very interesting lab, as I was shown the limitations of generative AI through its ability to perform a very specific task. For my full experience, please read my write up associated with this lab. To sum it up, I was surprised by ChatGPT's inability to rectify errors within its own API calls; however, I was impressed with its ability to make good suggestions to improve the web app. Without my human input, ChatGPT would be unable to identify and rectify its own errors, which I discovered when it was impossible to get it to solve problems with its own code that it could not visualize. I learned that ChatGPT, and all generative AI, is best used as a tool to learn from and gain inspiration to create something myself, rather than rely on it to create a functional product on its own.

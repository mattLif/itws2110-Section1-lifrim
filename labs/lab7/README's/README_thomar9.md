Contributions: I worked on creating the database for this lab in phpmyadmin. I used XAMPP to deploy the server on my local machine and worked in phpmyadmin and used SQL commands to develop the database. I then worked with my groupmates to modify their code to match the values I had used in the database I created. I had to refresh my memory with SQL commands and had to search up a lot of commands to follow the lab structure. Usually I would have made the tables mostly with the phpMyAdmin interface. For the most part this lab was pretty easy, however, I had a big blocker because I was unable to reach the phpmyadmin database for some time. I had tried to follow the posted material, but I couldn't follow the commands because of the differing operating systems(Mac vs Windows). After I installed XAMPP it all worked out and I was able to begin the lab.

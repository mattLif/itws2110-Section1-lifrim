My part: I was in charge of completing all of part 5 for lab 7. This meant creating a back end to the site with PHP that allows the user to interact with the database. It does this by retrieving the data from the json file about the Web Sys course and putting it into two separate MySQL tables named "Lectures" and "Labs". I also made a button so the user can delete these tables that were created so that it can be done multiple times. I also created the PHP to get the json file from the database so it could be fed to a script that would process it.

This lab went pretty well from my part, I just had to figure out how to get the data out of the json file so that it can be inserted with a MySQL command. The biggest blocker I ran into was making sure all of the names used in the json file and the MySQL table were all the same as what I was using.

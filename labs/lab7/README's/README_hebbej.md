# Lab7 README
### Jacob Hebbel

## Purpose
In this lab, PHP as an application backend was explored. Web applications without backends are stateless, however PHP and MySQL allow us to have persistent data kept across user sessions. This enables a web application to accomplish much more, such as storing important information and manipulating it upon user interactivity. By building skills with PHP and MySQL, I feel more confident in my ability to be an integral part of the Software Development Career Landscape.

## Contributions
In this lab, I contributed to the json document. I filled in the descriptions for labs and lectures. This isn't a lot, but its ok because we spun for tasks and I won.

## Blockers
I had no blockers.

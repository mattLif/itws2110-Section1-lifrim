Hello!
For Lab 1, I refreshed my memory on HTML formatting and development through Github. It was a good opportunity to brush up on the basics as well as get to know my group and make future plans for our group project. For example, I learned that while I am not proficient with CSS (as a result of poor artisitic skills), I have groupmates that excel at design and were able to assist greatly in making our webpages look sleek and aesthetic. I was able to use my past projects from Intro to ITWS as a starting point for my resume page. I had forgotten specific details at first, such as what went in the "head" segment of an HTML file. Luckily, I had my resume page from Intro, as well as all my other labs to remind me. This lab also served as a chance for me to reassess my actual resume I use for applications. I added recent work experiences and roles I hadn't before, such as my current tutor position here at RPI, as well as my membership with the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity. Overall, this lab benefitted me as a basics review, team-building exercise, and professional reevaluation.
